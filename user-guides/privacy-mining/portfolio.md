# Portfolio

The mining portfolio provides a comprehensive view of all active mining activities and past mining sessions linked to your account. It helps users track deposits, rewards, and overall mining performance in one place.

Your portfolio will appear empty when no mining activity has been conducted in your account. However, once mining begins, it will display active sessions and ongoing activities.

## Mining Statuses

The Mining Status indicates the current state of your mining session:

- **Deposit Processing:** This is the state immediately after making a deposit. At this status, the lock period has not yet started.
- **Mining in Progress:** This is the state when funds are locked during the mining period.
- **Canceled:** Mining was canceled midway or violated mining rules. If you are mining according to this website, you are not violating any rules.
- **Ready to Claim:** Mining rewards are available for claim.
- **Completed:** Mining rewards have been successfully claimed (however, redeposit may not yet be completed)

## Additional Notes

Mining activity is NOT reflected on the Transactions page. In other words, deposits and withdrawals related to mining will not appear in the regular Transactions list. However, deposits made for gas top-ups will be shown on the Transactions page.
