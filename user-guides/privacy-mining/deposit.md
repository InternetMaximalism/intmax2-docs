# Deposit

A deposit refers to transferring funds from the Ethereum Mainnet to the INTMAX network. Deposits must be made in fixed amounts of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 ETH. Simply select your preferred amount and click the "Mine" button to proceed.

Next, you will be prompted to confirm your deposit. Please note that once deposited, your funds will be locked and inaccessible until the specified lock period has passed. You must keep them in place until the lock period ends.

After initiating your transaction, it's important to keep your browser window open for at least the first 15 seconds. Doing so helps ensure that the transaction communicates successfully with the INTMAX network, facilitating a smooth start to the processing phase.

While most transactions finalize sooner, please allow up to 30 minutes for complete confirmation and processing on the INTMAX blockchain. Once your transaction has been fully confirmed, your mining operation will automatically begin.

## Additional Note

Please be aware that mining funds are managed separately from your primary Intmax address. As a result, any funds generated through mining operations will not appear in your standard INTMAX account balance. They can be tracked and managed exclusively within your dedicated mining portfolio.
