## Withdraw rest amount

When mining is completed, a small amount of ETH (roughly equivalent to the gas fee) may remain in the address.
This can occur especially if the withdrawal was executed when Ethereum gas fees were high.
Below is an explanation of the procedure to withdraw this remaining ETH.

1. If there is more ETH remaining than the gas fee in the address used for mining, a "Withdraw Rest Amount" button will be displayed.
   If you wish to withdraw this amount, please click the "Withdraw Rest Amount" button.

2. The withdrawal destination address can only be the same as the one used previously.
You cannot choose a different address freely.
