## Withdraw rest amount

When mining is completed, a small amount of ETH (roughly equivalent to the gas fee) may remain in the address.
This can occur especially if the withdrawal was executed when Ethereum gas fees were high.
Below is an explanation of the procedure to withdraw this remaining ETH.

1. If there is more ETH remaining than the gas fee in the address used for mining, a "Withdraw Rest Amount" button will be displayed.
   If you wish to withdraw this amount, please click the "Withdraw Rest Amount" button.

2. The withdrawal destination address can only be the same as the one used previously.
You cannot choose a different address freely.

**NOTE**: If you close the screen during the process, please start over from the beginning of the procedure.

### Cancel Mining

You can cancel a mining session even before the lock period has matured. However, please note that if you cancel, **no rewards will be granted**, and only the deposited ETH will be returned.

1. First, click the **"Cancel Mining Session"** button.

2. A confirmation dialog will then appear, warning you that if the lock period has not yet ended, you may lose the chance to receive rewards.
By selecting **"Yes, Proceed"**, the cancellation process will continue, and you will be redirected to the withdrawal screen.
