Terms of Use (Mainnet)

Last Updated: September 02, 2025

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the INTMAX mainnet protocol, network, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Definitions

For clarity, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:

- INTMAX Protocol: A stateless, privacy-focused Layer 2 (L2) rollup protocol on Ethereum, also referred to as Intmax2, designed for efficient, private token transfers with minimal on-chain data usage (e.g., 5 bytes per transaction, 0.08 bytes per transfer when batching up to 64 transfers).
- INTMAX Wallet: A separate, fully homomorphic encryption-multi-party computation (FHE-MPC) wallet independent from the INTMAX Protocol. It supports interactions with the Protocol but does not inherently provide privacy features.
- Privacy Mining: A voluntary program where users contribute to the network's anonymity set by depositing and withdrawing funds (primarily ETH), earning ITX tokens as incentives. Governed by separate Privacy Mining Guidelines.
- ITX Token: The native utility token of the INTMAX ecosystem, issued solely through Privacy Mining, with a maximum supply of 1,001,000,000 tokens. Used for rewards, governance, and private transfers on the Protocol.
- Aggregator: A permissionless role in the Protocol responsible for batching transactions, generating commitments, and submitting aggregated data to the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1).
- Restricted Countries: Jurisdictions subject to international sanctions, including but not limited to those listed by OFAC, EU sanctions lists, or UN Security Council resolutions (e.g., North Korea, Iran, Syria).

## 2. Scope & Nature of Services

INTMAX is a non-custodial, privacy-focused L2 rollup protocol on Ethereum, specializing in stateless architecture for scalable, confidential token transfers. The Services involve real economic value, including deposits, transfers, withdrawals, and Privacy Mining. Users may operate privacy-supporting infrastructure via Privacy Mining, earning ITX incentives under the separate Privacy Mining Guidelines (accessible at https://docs.network.intmax.io/user-guides/privacy-mining/). Participation is voluntary and includes technical responsibilities like maintaining node uptime (for aggregators) and legal compliance.

Note: The INTMAX Wallet is independent and not covered by these Terms. Refer to its separate documentation.

Privacy Mining operates in phases:

- Phase 1: Ethereum L1 (ended October 2024).
- Phase 2: Base (ended June 26, 2025).
- Phase 3: Ethereum L1 (ongoing since June 26, 2025), with 2-5 day lock periods, halving events, and daily ITX issuance.

## 3. Eligibility & Compliance

You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the Services.

You warrant that:

- You are not a resident or entity of Restricted Countries.
- Your use complies with all applicable laws, including anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.
- You are not using the Services for speculative trading, illicit activities, or in violation of sanctions.

Deposits from high-risk addresses (e.g., sanctioned or flagged for illicit activity) may be rejected using decentralized on-chain analyzers. Users are responsible for their tax obligations related to ITX rewards or transactions.

## 4. Authorized Usage

The Services are for lawful purposes only. Prohibited activities include:

- Money laundering, terrorism financing, or any illicit behavior.
- Attempting to circumvent Privacy Mining rules (e.g., detectable fund circulation patterns).
- Interfering with the Protocol's operation, such as submitting invalid transactions or exploiting vulnerabilities.

Aggregators must be online for liveness and use relayer contracts to mitigate delays/replays.

## 5. Decentralization & Autonomy

INTMAX provides open-source smart contracts and infrastructure but does not control user transactions, balances, or Privacy Mining operations. Block production is permissionless and stateless, with aggregators handling commitments without knowledge of transaction details.

You are solely responsible for:

- Securing your hardware, software, wallets, and private keys.
- Verifying transaction proofs and balances client-side.
- Interacting with third-party services (e.g., Ethereum L1, wallets) at your own risk.

The Protocol relies on Ethereum for security; any Ethereum network issues (e.g., forks, congestion) may affect the Services.

## 6. Data, Privacy & Privacy Mining Participation

We collect minimal data as per our Privacy Policy (accessible at https://intmax.io/privacy-policy) and applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The Privacy Policy is incorporated herein; in case of conflict, these Terms prevail.

## 7. Risks Disclosure

Using the Services involves significant risks, including but not limited to:

- Technical Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities, ZKP failures, client-side computation errors, or Ethereum dependencies (e.g., gas fees, network forks).
- Financial Risks: Volatility of ITX or deposited assets; loss due to slashing, invalid transactions, or market changes.
- Privacy Risks: Potential de-anonymization attacks if best practices are not followed; intermediaries in payment channels must be online.
- Regulatory Risks: Changes in laws affecting privacy protocols, tokens, or mining; classification of ITX as a security.
- Operational Risks: Delayed block publication, replay attacks (mitigated via timestamps), or aggregator liveness issues.
- Economic Risks: Halving events reducing rewards; no guarantees on ITX value or mining profitability.
- Third-Party Risks: Reliance on wallets, oracles, or L1; no liability for their failures.

Users bear all risks; conduct due diligence.

## 8. No Warranty

The Services, including Privacy Mining, are provided "as-is" without warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

## 9. Limitation of Liability & Indemnity

To the fullest extent permitted by law, INTMAX, Ryodan Systems AG, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the Services, even if advised of such possibility. Liability is limited to the amount of fees paid by you in the past 12 months, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. You indemnify INTMAX against claims arising from your misuse, regulatory violations, or participation in Privacy Mining.

## 10. Intellectual Property

All INTMAX branding, documentation, and source materials remain property of Ryodan Systems AG (or affiliates). Smart contracts are open-source under applicable licenses (e.g., GPL).

## 11. Termination & Suspension

INTMAX may suspend or terminate your access to centralized components (e.g., website, API) for ToS violations, suspected illegality, or security reasons. You may appeal via

support@intmax.io. Decentralized Protocol access cannot be terminated.

## 12. Force Majeure

INTMAX is not liable for failures due to events beyond control, including network outages, regulatory changes, or natural disasters.

## 13. Third-Party Services

The Services may integrate with third parties (e.g., Ethereum, wallets). INTMAX disclaims liability for their performance or risks.

## 14. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms; continued use implies acceptance. Material changes will be notified via website or email.

## 15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by Swiss law. Disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration by the Swiss Arbitration Centre, seated in Zurich, with one arbitrator, in English. Exceptions for injunctive relief (e.g., IP violations) may be sought in Swiss courts. Arbitration is final; no class actions.
