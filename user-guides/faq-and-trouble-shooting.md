# FAQ & Trouble Shooting

### Q: I would like to know more details about mining rules and learn how to earn ITX.

A: Please note that the tokens you can claim on the INTMAX Testnet are testnet-specific and differ from the ITX tokens on the Mainnet.

Meanwhile, mining is already live on the Ethereum Mainnet try it at https://intmax.io. While the ITX mined cannot be transferred at the moment, it will be a transferable token that can be used within the INTMAX ecosystem in the future.

### Q: Why do you receive ITX when you deposit 0.1ETH or 1ETH?

A: In Privacy Mining, you receive ITX as a reward for contributing to privacy creation by depositing 0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, 10 ETH, or 100 ETH. Since depositing the same amount is essentially the same as the work done in mining, you are eligible to receive a reward.

### Q: I believe Privacy Mining is currently being done through the CLI, so how is this Testnet mining different?

A: Currently, it is possible to obtain ITX that will actually circulate in the market in the future, rather than Testnet tokens.
Now mining is possible through the CLI and also through a user-friendly UI/UX at https://app.intmax.io

### Q: There are tokens called INT and INTMX. Are these tokens related to INTMAX?

A: No, those are scams pretending to be INTMAX.
Please be careful and avoid any involvement with them.
Our token is called ITX, and it does not yet have a transfer function.
Therefore, any claims that it can be bought or sold are completely false.

### Q: Although the wallet should be connected, the balance and other details are not being displayed.

A: Please try the following steps:
Reload the website.
Close all open tabs in the browser, then close the browser itself. Reopen the browser afterward.
Ensure that extensions other than the wallet you are using are set so they do not read or modify site data unless clicked.

### Q: What is the recommended way to use wallet apps on mobile devices?

A: When using a mobile wallet on an mobile device, it is highly recommended to access DApps through the In-App Browser provided within each wallet application. Some wallets may become unstable when connecting to DApps via external mobile browsers like Chrome or Brave. This can result in issues with DApp communication or signing transactions. Using the In-App Browser ensures that the wallet and DApp operate within the same secure environment, significantly reducing connection issues.

### Q: Which mobile wallets support In-App Browser usage?

A: Popular mobile wallets that support In-App Browsers include:

- MetaMask
- Trust Wallet
- Coinbase Wallet
- OKX Wallet

### Q: It looks like the assets I deposited for mining have disappeared. How can I verify them?

A: Note that regular deposits and mining deposits use different addresses. Regular deposits appear on the Transactions page, while mining deposits appear on the Mining Portfolio page.
If the issue still persists, please check using the steps below.

Please verify the deposited address by following the steps below.

1. Open [the mining address list page](https://app.intmax.io/mining-address-list).
2. Sign twice with the connected wallet; a list of related addresses will appear.
3. Take a screenshot of this list and share it with support.
4. This screen allows you to do two things:
   a. **Download user data files:** Checking this file will let you confirm your balance.
   b. **Check the withdrawal address:** This displays the Ethereum (Sepolia) address that will be used for re-deposits. If you choose to redeposit, you can verify on Etherscan that ETH has been deposited to this address.
